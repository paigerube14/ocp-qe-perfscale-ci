Each “source” repository is treated independently; configurations for different “source” repositories don’t interact. \n If the \"mirrors\" is not specified, the image will continue to be pulled from the specified repository in the pull spec. \n When multiple policies are defined for the same “source” repository, the sets of defined mirrors will be merged together, preserving the relative order of the mirrors, if possible. For example, if policy A has mirrors `a, b, c` and policy B has mirrors `c, d, e`, the mirrors will be used in the order `a, b, c, d, e`.  If the orders of mirror entries conflict (e.g. `a, b` vs. `b, a`) the configuration is not rejected but the resulting order is unspecified. Users who want to use a deterministic order of mirrors, should configure them into one list of mirrors using the expected order.","type":"array","items":{"description":"ImageTagMirrors holds cluster-wide information about how to handle mirrors in the registries config.","type":"object","required":["source"],"properties":{"mirrorSourcePolicy":{"description":"mirrorSourcePolicy defines the fallback policy if fails to pull image from the mirrors.

No mirror will be configured if not specified. Images can be pulled from these mirrors only if they are referenced by their tags. The mirrored location is obtained by replacing the part of the input reference that matches source by the mirrors entry, e.g. for registry.redhat.io/product/repo reference, a (source, mirror) pair *.redhat.io, mirror.local/redhat causes a mirror.local/redhat/product/repo repository to be used. Pulling images by tag can potentially yield different images, depending on which endpoint we pull from. Configuring a list of mirrors using \"ImageDigestMirrorSet\" CRD and forcing digest-pulls for mirrors avoids that issue. The order of mirrors in this list is treated as the user's desired priority, while source is by default considered lower priority than all mirrors. If no mirror is specified or all image pulls from the mirror list fail, the image will continue to be pulled from the repository in the pull spec unless explicitly prohibited by \"mirrorSourcePolicy\".
